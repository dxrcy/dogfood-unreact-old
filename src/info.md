# Almonds

`nut, fruit, white`

-   MAYBE

In moderation.

It is best to limit almonds in your dog’s diet. Although plain, unsalted almonds are generally safe for dogs to eat in small amounts, they are difficult for dogs to digest and may lead to vomiting and diarrhea. Almonds are also high in fat and calories and have the potential to cause weight gain and pancreatitis in dogs. If you feed your dog almonds, it is best to give very small servings.

# Apple

`fruit, core, peel, red`

-   OK

Yes, dogs can eat apples. Apples are an excellent source of vitamins A and C, as well as fiber for your dog. They are low in protein and fat, making them the perfect snack for senior dogs. Just be sure to remove the seeds and core first. Try them frozen for an icy warm weather snack. You can also find it as an ingredient in apple-flavored dog treats.

# Asparagus

`veggie, vegetable, green`

-   BAD

No, dogs should not eat asparagus. While asparagus isn’t necessarily unsafe for dogs, there’s really no point in giving it to them. It’s too tough to be eaten raw, and by the time you cook it down so it’s soft enough for dogs to eat, asparagus loses the nutrients it contains. If you really want to share a veggie, something more beneficial is probably best.

# Avocado

`fruit, vegetable, veggie, green, salad, guacamole`

-   BAD

No, dogs should not eat avocado. While avocado may be a healthy snack for dog owners, it should not be given to dogs at all. The pit, skin, and leaves of avocados contain persin, a toxin that often causes vomiting and diarrhea in dogs. The fleshy inside of the fruit doesn’t have as much persin as the rest of the plant, but it is still too much for dogs to handle.

# Banana

`fruit, peel, yellow`

-   OK

Yes, dogs can eat bananas. In moderation, bananas are a great low-calorie treat for dogs. They’re high in potassium, vitamins, biotin, fiber, and copper.

# Blackberries

`fruit, berry, berries, black`

-   OK

You can safely feed your dog blackberries. Fresh or frozen blackberries are a healthy treat for dogs. They are low in calories and rich in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.

Bones are a good source of minerals and other nutrients and help satisfy your dog's appetite. ... Don't give you dog cooked bones of any kind. Don't let your dog chew any kind of bone into small pieces. Don't give your dog chunks of bone that can cause blockages. Do not feed dogs chicken bones, weather cooked or raw, as they are weak and can splinter in your dog's mouth.

# Bread

`grain, brown`

-   OK

Cooked.

Plain white or whole grain bread is safe for most dogs to eat as an occasional treat. Before feeding your dog bread, make sure it doesn’t contain any extra ingredients, such as raisins, which could be potentially harmful. Additionally, keep in mind that bread, along with other foods, adds extra calories to your dog’s diet and may cause weight gain if he eats too much.

1. https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/human-foods-for-dogs

> Loves bread, but not so much the crust.

# Bread dough

`grain, raw, white`

-   BAD

Raw or undercooked.

While bread is generally safe for dogs, the dough can be very dangerous. The yeast in dough can cause it to keep expanding inside the dog’s stomach, which can cause bloating and lead to dangerous complications. The yeast also produces ethanol, and this can cause alcohol poisoning.

# Cantaloupe

`fruit, orange`

-   MAYBE

# Capsicum / Pepper

`veggie, vegetable, yellow, green, red`

-   OK

For pet owners, it can be difficult to keep track of which foods are harmful to dogs. For example, can dogs eat bell peppers? In this instance, the answer is yes. Bell peppers pack a punch when it comes to nutritional value for both you and your furry friend. “They’re not toxic, and they are a healthy alternative snack to share with your dog,” says Dr. Carly Fox, a staff doctor at New York City’s Animal Medical Center.

1. https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/nutrition/can-dogs-eat-bell-peppers/

# Carrots

`veggie, vegetable, orange`

# Cashews

`nut, fruit, white`

-   MAYBE

In moderation.

You should limit your dog’s intake of cashews. Plain, unsalted and roasted cashews are safe for most dogs to eat in moderation. However, cashews are high in fat and calories and may lead to weight gain and pancreatitis when consumed in excess (4, 11Trusted Source). For these reasons, you should limit your dog’s intake to one or two cashews a day or less.

# Celery

`veggie, vegetable, green`

# Cheese

`dairy, milk, yellow, white`

-   MAYBE

In moderation.

Cheese is safe for most dogs to eat in small quantities. Due to the fat and lactose content of cheese, some dogs may have digestive symptoms, such as stomach pain and diarrhea, after eating it. To avoid unpleasant symptoms, it is best to introduce cheese into your dog’s diet gradually. It may also help to only feed your dog low-fat cheeses, such as mozzarella.

1. https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/human-foods-for-dogs

> Loves cheese.

# Cherries

`fruit, berry, berries, red`

-   BAD

No, dogs should not eat cherries. With the exception of the fleshy part around the seed, cherry plants contain cyanide and are toxic to dogs. Cyanide disrupts cellular oxygen transport, which means that your dog’s blood cells can’t get enough oxygen. If your dog eats cherries, be on the lookout for dilated pupils, difficulty breathing, and red gums, as these may be signs of cyanide poisoning.

# Chewing Gum

`chewie, bubble, gum`

-   BAD

In 2016, there were more than 250 cases of xylitol poisoning in the UK reported to the Veterinary Poisons Information Service – and most of these were down to dogs getting their paws on chewing gum.

# Chickpeas

`lentil, nut, fruit, legume, pea, brown`

-   MAYBE

Not Hummus.

Chickpeas can make gassy pets worse (sorry, bulldogs—we’re calling you out!) and lead to abdominal cramps and bloating. Introduce these legumes slowly and watch for gastrointestinal issues. Avoid processed chickpeas, such as those turned into hummus, which are full of spices and seasonings that, while delicious to you, can harm your dog. Stick with bland, cooked chickpeas, and skip the seasonings.

1. https://trupanion.com/pet-care/can-dogs-eat-chickpeas

# Chocolate

`caffeine, sweet, brown`

-   BAD

Never give chocolate, coffee, or anything containing caffeine to dogs. These products contain chemicals called methylxanthines, which are highly toxic to dogs.

# Corn

`veggie, vegetable, yellow`

-   MAYBE

In moderation; Not cob.

Dogs can eat corn in moderate amounts. Corn is a good source of some vitamins and minerals and common ingredient in many types of dog food. A tablespoon or two of corn per day is an appropriate serving size for dogs. Although plain, cooked corn kernels are safe for dogs, you should never feed your dog corn on the cob. The cob is a choking hazard and could lead to intestinal obstruction if consumed.

1. https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/human-foods-for-dogs

# Corn Cob

`veggie, vegetable, yellow`

-   BAD

Inside part.

Unlike most vegetables, corn on the cobs don’t digest in a dog’s stomach. That means they are likely to cause a blockage, and possible perforation, if they’re left to make their way through the intestines.

# Cranberries

`fruit, berry, berries, red`

-   MAYBE

Small quantities.

Yes, cranberries are safe for dogs to eat. Both cranberries and dried cranberries are safe to feed to dogs in small quantities. Whether your dog will like this tart treat is another question.

# Dairy

`milk, cheese, butter, cream, cow, yogurt`

-   MAYBE

Dairy products, such as milk, cheese, and plain yogurt, are safe for dogs to have in very small quantities. Eating too much dairy can cause digestive problems. This is because dogs have low levels of lactase, a digestive enzyme that breaks down the sugars in milk. Dogs with lactose intolerance should not eat dairy products. Signs of lactose intolerances include diarrhea or vomiting after consuming anything that contains dairy.

# Eggs

-   OK

Cooked.

Cooked eggs are perfectly safe and nutritious for dogs to eat. One medium egg provides some of almost every vitamin and mineral, plus lots of protein. There are claims that eggs may also help relieve nausea in dogs, although there is no scientific evidence behind this claim. It is important to note that you should avoid feeding raw eggs to your dog. While dogs typically do not get sick from eating raw eggs, bacteria, such as Salmonella, can spread from the dog to its human owners, increasing their risk of infection.

# Falafel

`chickpeas, fried, fry, brown`

-   BAD

Falafel is usually made with soaked raw chickpeas or chickpea flour. While neither of these may harm, other ingredients such as onions or garlic added to the falafel are bad for dogs. These can cause fatal anemia. Some signs of anemia are weakness, depression, or rapid breathing. Falafel is often deep-fried, so it’s not the best food choice. The fat from the oil can cause gut problems and a painful condition called pancreatitis.

# Fish

`seafood, salmon, tuna, shrimp, prawn, cod, ocean, meat, shellfish, shell, white, red`

The B vitamins in shrimp can also help maintain a dog’s digestive system and promote healthy blood circulation. It is important to cook fish before feeding it to a dog, as uncooked fish can contain harmful parasites.

# Honey

`bee, syrup, nectar, yellow`

In moderation.

You should only feed honey to your dog in limited amounts. Honey has a high sugar content, which can add up in calories and contribute to weight gain if your dog eats too much.

The simple answer is yes, dogs can eat pancakes! Unless your canine friend has a dairy intolerance or an allergy, there shouldn’t be anything in pancake batter to cause them any harm.

# Walnut

`nut, brown`

-   BAD

But the reason walnuts shouldn't be offered to your pooch is that they're susceptible to a particular type of black mold that can prove extremely toxic to canines. While it's not likely to occur in high-quality walnuts that you might find at the grocery store, walnuts that have been collected outdoors from trees aren't safe for pets.

Additionally, you should also look for yogurt that has lots of live cultures, such as plain, Greek-style yogurt. This yogurt is better because it has lower levels of lactose than regular yogurt.
